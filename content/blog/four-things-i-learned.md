Hi!

It's my last day at SingTel after almost 2 years and I thought I'd share some tips I learned here!

**Disclaimer:** I'm nowhere near an expert or 10x software engineer, but these tips helped me in my time at Singtel.
Hope these help you in your career too! Let's goooo

## 1. Your code sucks, not you

When someone criticises your code, don't take it personally. I often see developers get disappointed in themselves after a round of code review. You can be disappointed for a little while, but take this opportunity to better your code, not sulk and think you're not worthy.

> Nobody cares about your broken code after today: let go of your ego, take in feedback and learn

## 2. Read up & learn

People always think they can stop learning after university or they can rest on their laurels after learning the basics of React. These people are the ones who get left behind when a new tech emerges. My advice is to read and learn on your free time. Learning can take many different forms. These are my tips:

- Follow tech stories on social media like twitter and reddit to keep up with the current trends.

- Share interesting articles with your group of tech friends or colleagues. When they also share interesting links, you learn as well.

- Don't be afraid of difficult words like polymorphism, functional/imperative, SOLID, TDD, etc. Read about them one by one and take your time to digest. If you can't understand the first time, rest, then go back to it again.

- Learn patterns like SOLID and GRASP to level up your code.

- Apply these to your work. Find use cases where you can practise your craft. That's when you get really good. You have to do it.

- Validate your ideas with someone. Talk to someone about your ideas. He/she might have better ideas and you can bounce off ideas with each other.

## 3. Don’t reinvent the wheel

Your reinvented wheel probably sucks. There is a high chance a library is already out there that does the exact thing you want to achieve. They might do the same thing as your code, but they are already well tested and production-ready with edge cases solved after many rounds of iteration. You would have just started to realise your wheel isn't as round as you want it to be after your first release.

> Point is, don't waste your time writing an existing library from scratch. You will fail badly.

## 4. Question the requirements handed to you

Please don’t take requirements as-is. Requirements handed down from business are usually written by people who knows nothing about tech. If you don't question the requirements, you will end up writing code that will be thrown away quick. Keep asking why.

I think that's about all the wisdom I can write down at the moment haha. I'm looking forward to my next job at Seedly, but also also looking backward at the time I spent in SingTel and reflecting on what I've done.

Thank you for reading the post!
